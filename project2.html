        <h1>Project goal</h1>

        <p>The goal of our project is to ease the stress of UST students.</p>

        <h1>Learning</h1>
        
        <p>Project 2 further develop my skill of prototyping.<br>
            By designing different prototypes, the optimal one can be found.</p>

        <p>Our team found that many of the students in HKUST are stressing out.</p>

        <p>Therefore, our team proposed to create a chatbot to provide emotional support to our fellow UST students.</p>

            <p>Surveying schoolmates</p>

            <p>Designing story lines of the chatbot</p>

        <h1>reflection</h1>
        <p>Through this project, I gained the knowledge of the process to create an working prototype from an ideated idea.<br>
        After creating a prototype, it is important to make sure that the user is comfortable to use the product and provides actual help to the user.<br>
        If more data is collected, the chatbot can potentially have a larger user group outside UST.
