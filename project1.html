        <h1>Project goal</h1>

        <p>The goal of our team is to find a solution to modify the Path Advisor so that it is more user-friendly</p>

        <h1>Learning</h1>
        
        <p>Project 1 helps me to perform the ideation process we have learned in lesson.<br>
            The purpose of ideation is to propose a potential problem some group of users might be facing and provide a solution.</p>

        <p>Our team found that many of the students in HKUST are not satisfied with the current Path Advisor,<br>
        maily the outdated UI and poor navigation system.</p>

        <p>Therefore, our team proposed to make improvement to the UI and deploy the AR navigation system as a solution to the user needs.</p>

        <h1>reflection</h1>
        <p>Through this project, I gained the knowledge to collect user needs and make it into a story board.<br>
        Story board is a great tool to generalize the solution idea and present our ideas to the users in a clear manner.<br>
        Next time, I will try to gain the opinition from a wider variety of users, since we only interviewed HKUST students in this project.
