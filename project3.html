            COMP4461 Project 3 Social Extended Reality (XR) for Lifelong Learning

            Deadline:
            •	Sun May 7	P3.1 Submit group project presentation to Canvas 
            •	Mon May 8	P3.2 In-class presentation and peer evaluation
            •	Fri May 12	P3.3 Launch P3 personal diary page in Slack #project3-socialxr (11:59pm)


            Project Description
            •	Same 5~6-person group, switch task assignments (must be different from Project 1 and 2)
            •	Empathize: Identify a user scenario for social extended reality (XR) 
            o	Definition of lifelong learning: people want to learn anytime and anywhere, inside or outside of the classroom throughout their lives (https://uil.unesco.org/)
            o	Explore activities and events through which people want to carry out lifelong learning (e.g., science, language, art, soft skills, any kind of professional and daily knowledge/skills, etc.).
            o	Justify your group's choice of topic based on needfinding with potential users
            •	Ideate about the use of Social XR Platforms; discuss the pros & cons of existing solutions
            o	Construct POV
            o	Brainstorming ideas
            o	Storyboarding
            o	Speed dating
            •	Build a prototype (interactive demo) of your final proposed solution
            o	Development: show features for an envisioned future. Key feature design needs to be demonstrated on top of the Hubs system. Note that Hubs can be programmed if needed.
            o	Evaluation: conduct a qualitative user evaluation.
            o	Demonstration: submit a video link of the demo (Slack #project3-socialxr). Bonus may be given to working prototypes.
            •	Present your group project in class
            o	Presentation + demonstration (live or video recording)
            o	Q&A
            o	Peer evaluation
            •	Write your personal diary of Project 3
            o	Document the process and results with text, pictures, videos, etc.
            o	Stress your own contribution and thinking
            o	Submit the page link to Slack #project3-socialxr

            Flow of P3.2 Presentation (7 min presentation + 1 min Q&A per team)
            •	Brief introduction
            •	Your group's choice of topic
            1.	Present needfinding process and results
            2.	Construction of the POV (show it)
            3.	Brainstorming process for coming up with various solutions
            4.	Storyboarding the various solutions
            5.	Evaluating the initial proposals via speed dating (using the storyboards) and summarizing the evaluation results and present the final proposed solution (with justification)
            6.	Documenting the prototyping processing
            7.	Complete demonstration of the final prototype in intended scenario
            8.	Brief reflection on the project (take home messages, lessons learned, etc.)
            o	Anything else to add, clarify, or highlight
            o	Acknowledgement, if any
            •	Q&A

            Criteria used in P3.2 Peer Evaluation (group-based)
            •	Human centricity: human-centered design 
            •	Soundness of the choice of topic
            •	Practicality of Social XR as a solution to the specified user need
            •	Effect of proposed solution on the selected type of remote together experience
            •	Demo quality 

            Requirement for P3.3 Personal Diary
            •	Project 3 page with a complete personal diary of the project
            •	Highlight your own contributions and thoughts in the project

            Note
            •	Your final score = group performance (peer + expert) + individual performance (diary)

            FAQ
            •	Q: How many scenarios shall we implement?
            A: You may brainstorm many possible scenarios and pick one only for prototyping – with justifications.

            •	Q: What level of implementation is expected?
            A: Your implementation should 1) give the audience a sense of Social XR  and 2) showcase some kind of user interaction involved. The rest can be demonstrated in a wizard-of-the-oz fashion in the video.

            •	Q: What is the ideal length of video prototype?
            A: Pick a length appropriate for your usage scenario, as long as the whole presentation would not exceed the time limit. The quality of the prototype demo will not be judged by the length of video.

            •	Q: How are the points distributed between teamwork and personal portfolio?
            A: Project 3 is 20 points: 15 points come from peer+TA evaluation during the in-class presentation (weighted by individual contribution), and 5 points are assigned to the personal portfolio page of P3. See the detailed criteria in project description.

            •	Q: What if the social XR platform we choose doesn't have the features I would like to include?
            A: You can demonstrate it through video prototype or build your own by programming Hubs if you are an expert on this.

        <h1>Project goal</h1>

        <p>The goal of our project is to provide an vocabulary learning AR experience for life long learning</p>

        <h1>Learning</h1>
        
        <p> Project 3 provide me some basic concepts of applying  XR technologies.<br>
            XR technologies provides users many new ways to interact with the reality.<br>
            User can be more engaged to the activity by applying those technologies .</p>

        <p>Language learning is one of the most popular life long learn goal for many people.</p>

        <p>Our team decided to propose an language learning tool with AR technology.</p>
        
        <h1>My contributions</h1>
            <p>Survey design</p>

            <p>Construct POV</p>>

        <h1>reflection</h1>
        <p> XR technology is a powerful and universal tool. 
            Language learning can be easily achieved by applying AR technology. 
            The real challenge is how to apply this technology to all age groups for life long learning.
            I learned that keeping the interface simple and clean is the simplist way to create an application usable for any age group of people.
